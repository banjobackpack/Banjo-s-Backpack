##General Info
Developed by Brendan "Skill", Banjo's Backpack is a robust rom editing toolkit for Banjo-Kazooie. It includes a map editor along with various other tools for importing/viewing models, music, sprites, etc. Unfortunately, after spending a number of years on this project, the original author has gone MIA since 2018 which has resulted in abandonment of this project. Therefore, I've gone ahead and decompiled the source code of BB v2a006 with dotPeek in the hopes that its legacy can be preserved and that it will be expanded upon by anyone interested in Banjo Kazooie modding. 

I won't be maintaining this project or repository but feel free to branch or start your own with the source files.
