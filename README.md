## General Info
Developed by Brendan "Skill", Banjo's Backpack is a robust rom editing toolkit for Banjo-Kazooie. It includes a map editor along with various other tools for importing/viewing models, music, sprites, etc. Unfortunately, after spending a number of years developing the toolkit, the original author has gone MIA since 2018 which has resulted in abandonment of this project. Therefore, I've gone ahead and decompiled the source code of BB v2a006 with dotPeek in the hopes that its legacy can be preserved and that it will be expanded upon by anyone interested in Banjo Kazooie modding. 

I won't be maintaining this project or repository but feel free to branch or start your own with the source files. 

## Project Requirements
Compiles in Visual Studio 2017. Haven't tested later versions but should work. Before you run the executable in your bin output folder you should include the folders 'out', 'resources' and 'tmp' from your copy of Banjo's Backpack v2a006 which you can find the link to below.

## Banjo Kazooie Globalizer Source Code
This isn't a requirement to compile and run Banjo's Backpack. It's a plugin utility BB uses to allow level-specific assets to be used anywhere in the game. Here you can find the source code just in case modifications need to be made due to bugs or whatever.
